### SVHN

The SVHN data must be downloaded into the folder ./svhn/mat in your home directory only then will one be able to run the files.

The data can be downloaded from http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/ "Format 2: Cropped Digits" is what this project aims to work on

The first four parts involve simple implementation of different variables. Shared VAriables and TensorBoard visualisations are also cvered. Each folder has a readme file that explains the implimentations and results.

The SVHN++ is the final implimentation, it used dropout and attains and 89% accuracy on the test data.
